# Last Change Marketplace

A fully decentralized, peer-to-peer, and secure marketplace built on the **Proof of Work (PoW)** consensus algorithm.

## Manifesto

We believe that buying and selling is a natural human rightâ€”one that has existed since the dawn of civilization and must never be taken away by monopolies or corruption.

Last Change restores this right by providing a browser-free, intermediary-free marketplace that guarantees freedom of trade using cryptography and distributed networks.

## Features

- No browser needed; all transactions occur through a peer-to-peer network.  
- High security ensured by the Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm.  
- Encrypted and distributed ledger to record transactions and seller ratings.  
- Native cryptocurrency to incentivize participation and facilitate transactions.  
- Full privacy and anonymity for users.  
- Off-chain storage for large files like product images; only secure links are stored on the ledger.  
- Consensus mechanism to evaluate and rate sellers to prevent fraud.  
- Rewards for active nodes with the native cryptocurrency.

3. Avoid sharing personal details in your profile, README, or commits.  
4. Use a VPN to hide your IP and location while working.
